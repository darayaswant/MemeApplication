As a part of Crio Winter of Doing, I have built XMeme web app where you can post memes by providing your name, a caption for the meme and the URL for the meme image as input. It's a full stack application and TechStack used
      Frontend - using html, css, js
      Backend- using spring boot, maven
      Database-mysql
      Database connector- jpa (java persistence api)
      Frontend deployed in aws ec2
      Backend deployed in aws elastic bean stalk(http://xmeme-env.eba-bwbueset.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/memes)
      Cloud database (aws rds)
